This year I finally managed to complete an entry for the [Binary Golf Grand Prix](https://binary.golf/). It's nothing fancy, just a quick take on a self-replicating HTML file. The challenge is to create a self-replicating file which must make one copy of itself, named the copy `4`, not run that copy, and display or output the number 4. I figured a self-replicating HTML would be a good introduction to golfing, and seeing just how small I could get the file  would be interesting, for sure.

My final result is a 123 byte file, which displays the number 4 in the browser, and downloads an exact copy of itself to a file named 4 in your downloads directory.
```
<body>4<script>d=document;f=d.createElement('a');f.href='data:;,<body>'+d.body.innerHTML;f.download='4';f.click();</script>
```

We are able to get this as small as it is by using the variable `d` to represent `document` at two places in the file, not specifying a data type in the download, and not closing the `<body>` tag. I am still hunting for other possibilities to shave off another byte or two.
