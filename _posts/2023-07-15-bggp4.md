This year I finally managed to complete an entry for the [Binary Golf Grand Prix](https://binary.golf/). It's nothing fancy, just a quick take on a self-replicating HTML file. The challenge is to create a self-replicating file which must make one copy of itself, named the copy `4`, not run that copy, and display or output the number 4. I figured a self-replicating HTML would be a good introduction to golfing, and seeing just how small I could get the file  would be interesting, for sure.

My final result is a 123 byte file, which displays the number 4 in the browser, and downloads an exact copy of itself to a file named 4 in your downloads directory.

`<body>4<script>d=document;f=d.createElement('a');f.href='data:;,<body>'+d.body.innerHTML;f.download='4';f.click();</script>`

We are able to get this as small as it is by using the variable `d` to represent `document` at two places in the file, not specifying a data type in the download, and not closing the `<body>` tag. I am still hunting for other possibilities to shave off another byte or two.

UPDATE 07/17/23

After making this post and submitting this entry, I received a reply on Mastodon from [@eater@cijber.social](https://cijber.social/@eater) pointing out that I can remove some single quotes to remove a few more bytes. eater then proceeded to to take my entry and golf it down to around 94 bytes. I was already in bed at this point, but couldn't stop thinking about it. I got out of bed and got back to work. After a few failed attempts at lowering the size of the script section of my file, I realize I could move some of the `<a>` tag outside of the script and assign it an id to manipulate from inside the script. I can then completely remove the body tag and only use the `<a>` and `<script>` tags. I can also reference the a tag id, replacing the `innerHTML` property with `outerHTML` to append the file contents to my href data proprty. The final result lowers my file size all the way down to 83 bytes.

`<a download="4" id="f">4<script>f.href='data:,'+f.outerHTML;f.click();</script></a>`

Huge thanks to eater for kicking my brain into high gear last night and for the collab, even if I didn't have you send over your final result.
