zh3r0 CTF - Hacking Machine Challenges

NOTE: I wrote most of this before they added flags 6 and 7, so those are not written up here.

At the start of the challenges we aren't given much information, other than we are looking for five flags,
and they are all on hackit.zh3r0.ml. First things first, let's run an nmap scan.
```

```
So we can see only a few services running. First thing that will notice is we've already found our first flag,
just for doing a full scan. Another thing that you should notice pretty quickly is that port 22 is open,
but it is not running SSH. There is a web server hidden there. Firefox will not let you visit port 22 because
it is not a standard HTTP port, so we'll check it out with curl.
```
root@kali:~# curl http://hackit.zh3r0.ml:22                                                 
z3hr0{shouldve_added_some_filter_here}
```
That was pretty easy! You'll notice it didn't include what flag number it is, but we can narrow that down pretty
easily after we get the rest of the flags. Next up, let's check out that FTP server running on port 324, another non standard port.
```

```
So as you can see, they had some data hidden in ... directories, but we were able to find everything
thanks to the -la flags we used on ls. You can see I downloaded the .stayhidden and .flag files.
I also downloaded all three test.txt files, just to make sure I didn't mess anything. They
all turned out to be nothing. Let's check out what is in the other files.
```
root@kali:~# cat .stayhidden
Employee ID: 6890d90d349e3757013b02e495b1a87f
root@kali:~# cat .flag
Flag 2: zh3r0{You_know_your_shit}
```
We found our third out of five flags, as well as an employee ID. That looks like it could be useful
on that other port we found open, 4994. Let's go try it out!
```
root@kali:~# nc hackit.zh3r0.ml 4994

Books are a uniquely portable magic. - Stephen King

Flag 4: zh3r0{y0ur_s4l4ry_wa5_cr3dit3d}
```
Four flags down, only one to go! At this point in the challenge I spent a little too much time trying
to access SSH on port 99. I had found a flag on all of the other services so far, so I figured that must
be where the last flag is hidden. I tried various combinations of book related usernames and password due
to the Sherlock Holmes and Stephen King references. After a little while I took a break and decided to run
dirb against the webserver running on port 22.
```

```
As you can see we found a robots.txt, and downloaded it. It contains an encrypted string, which Cyber Chef will tell
us is a base58 when using the magic function. When decoded it sends us to a text file on the server. Let's go download it.
```
I tried to hide this, anyway, check out /clue3349203.txt

This is probably the trickiest part of the whole challenge. The file is full of what turns out to be JSFuck code.
Trying to track down some of these esoteric programming languages can be a real pain, especially since so many
look alike. After looking at a long list of example "Hello World" programs in different languages, I figured
out what it was and used a decoder I found on the web to get a string out of the mess. It's another employee ID!
Let's head over the port 4994 again and see what happens.
```
console.log('Employee ID: 865151c643cbbb7e3bf4fd5dbb71354e')

root@kali:~# nc hackit.zh3r0.ml 4994

Here's a free flag for you, just for finding this door! Flag 1: zh3r0{pr05_d0_full_sc4n5}

Heyo, Watcha looking at? Employee ID yoo! :

Hey I know you! You work here!
If you don't like to read, you haven't found the right book. - JK Rowling

Flag 3: zh3r0{y0ur_b0nu5_i5_p4id}
```
So that was a fun set of challenges. We got all five of the original flags with just some basic
scanning and utilities. Overall I didn't do great at the zh3r0 CTF but I had a lot of fun with these hacking machines.
