Hi, I'm [Mark](https://www.twitter.com/xfavatax).

I've coded and hacked for a while as a hobby, but never truly considered infosec as a career until recently. Having recently passed the Network+ exam, I am now working towards getting my Security+. I've recently moved my blog to Github so I can host code I've been writing in Go for Advent of Code, as well as my CTF write-ups and anything else I might choose to write about.
