Hi, I'm Mark.

I've coded and hacked for a while as a hobby, but never truly considered infosec as a career
until recently. Having recently passed the Network+ exam, I am now working towards getting my
Security+. I've recently moved my blog to Github so I can host code I've been writing in Go for
Advent of Code, as well as my CTF write-ups and anything else I might choose to write about.
